## Third-Party Dependencies and Acknowledgments

This project relies on and is developed as an extension for the **Bukkit/Spigot/Paper API**.

* This dependency allows the plugin to interact with the Minecraft server environment (e.g., handling player movement, damage events, commands).
* The underlying server software and its API are typically licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v3.0, but this plugin only uses the public interfaces and does **not** distribute the server implementation code itself.
