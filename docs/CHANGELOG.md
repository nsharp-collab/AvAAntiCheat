# Changelog

## [1.9.1.1-DEV] - 2025-12-08
- **THIS IS A TEST VERSION ONLY** Do not use in an actual server unless you know the security risk's (THERE MAY BE BUGS)
- **Dev:** Added a configuration system (`config.yml`) so server admins can set the plugin startup mode, enable/disable file logging, and change per-cheat kick limits.
- **Dev:** Made violation limits configurable at runtime (`flight`, `chat-spam`, `sequence`, `attack-speed`).
- **Dev:** `logToFile` now respects `enable-logging` and the log file is only created when logging is enabled.
- **Test:** Performed local compile/fix cycle to replace hard-coded constants with config-backed fields.

## [1.9.1] - 2025-12-02

- **Fix:** Corrected a major bug where players using the Riptide enchantment were incorrectly flagged and kicked for flying.
- **Fix:** Resolved a compilation error in the `killPlayer` method caused by a typo in the log message.
- **Code:** Refactored Riptide detection. Logic was removed from `EntityDamageByEntityEvent` and implemented correctly using the `PlayerRiptideEvent`.
- **Build:** Successful build artifact: `target/AvAAntiCheat-1.9.1.jar`.

## [1.8.8] - 2025-11-12

- **Build:** Switched project Java target to `17` to match Spigot API bytecode version and container JDK.
- **Build:** Updated `/pom.xml` to set `<maven.compiler.source>` and `<maven.compiler.target>` to `17`.
- **Code:** Removed dependency on `TridentMeta` and replaced `instanceof TridentMeta` checks with `ItemMeta.hasEnchant(...)`.
- **Dev:** Set the container JDK to Java 17 using SDKMAN and verified `mvn clean package` succeeds.
- **Output:** Successful build artifact: `target/AvAAntiCheat-1.8.8.jar`.

Notes:
- If you want to target Java 21 instead, update your environment JDK to 21 and set the Maven compiler properties back to `21`.
