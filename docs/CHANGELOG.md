# Changelog

## [1.9.4] - 2026-02-19

- **New Feature:** Implemented phasing detection that prevents players from passing through walls via packet manipulation or enderpearl clipping. Players caught phasing are rubber-banded back to their previous location.
- **Dev:** Added debug mode (`/ac debug`) allowing server operators to stream live anti-cheat logs to console for real-time monitoring.
- **Code:** Refactored logging system to run asynchronously; file I/O no longer blocks the main thread.
- **Code:** Added config version checking with automatic backup of outdated `config.yml` files to prevent configuration loss during updates.
- **Dev:** Made `checkPhaseEnabled` configurable in `config.yml` to allow operators to customize phase detection.
- **Code:** Improved comment clarity throughout codebase for better maintainability.
- **Build:** Updated version references across `pom.xml`, `plugin.yml`, and source code to v1.9.4.

## [1.9.2] - 2025-12-27

- **Dev:** Added a lightweight version-check notification so server operators are informed when the plugin is out of date.
- **Fix:** Prevented false kicks caused by Breeze charge attacks and related interactions; improved wall-climbing detection to avoid incorrect flags.
 - **Code:** Implemented new wall-climbing detection logic to better differentiate legitimate climbing from exploit-like behavior, reducing false positives.
 - **Release:** This version is intended for regular use (not a DEV/TEST build).

## [1.9.1.1-DEV] - 2025-12-08
- **THIS IS A TEST VERSION ONLY** Do not use in an actual server unless you know the security risk's (THERE MAY BE BUGS)
- **Dev:** Added a configuration system (`config.yml`) so server admins can set the plugin startup mode, enable/disable file logging, and change per-cheat kick limits.
- **Dev:** Made violation limits configurable at runtime (`flight`, `chat-spam`, `sequence`, `attack-speed`).
- **Dev:** `logToFile` now respects `enable-logging` and the log file is only created when logging is enabled.
- **Test:** Performed local compile/fix cycle to replace hard-coded constants with config-backed fields.

## [1.9.1] - 2025-12-02

- **Fix:** Corrected a major bug where players using the Riptide enchantment were incorrectly flagged and kicked for flying.
- **Fix:** Resolved a compilation error in the `killPlayer` method caused by a typo in the log message.
- **Code:** Refactored Riptide detection. Logic was removed from `EntityDamageByEntityEvent` and implemented correctly using the `PlayerRiptideEvent`.
- **Build:** Successful build artifact: `target/AvAAntiCheat-1.9.1.jar`.

## [1.8.8] - 2025-11-12

- **Build:** Switched project Java target to `17` to match Spigot API bytecode version and container JDK.
- **Build:** Updated `/pom.xml` to set `<maven.compiler.source>` and `<maven.compiler.target>` to `17`.
- **Code:** Removed dependency on `TridentMeta` and replaced `instanceof TridentMeta` checks with `ItemMeta.hasEnchant(...)`.
- **Dev:** Set the container JDK to Java 17 using SDKMAN and verified `mvn clean package` succeeds.
- **Output:** Successful build artifact: `target/AvAAntiCheat-1.8.8.jar`.

Notes:
- If you want to target Java 21 instead, update your environment JDK to 21 and set the Maven compiler properties back to `21`.
