### Supported Minecraft Server Versions

Our server supports stable versions of **Paper** and its forks (like Purpur).

| Version | Status | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **1.21.10** | **Supported** | This is the current recommended and tested version. |
| **Older Versions** | **Unsupported** | versions older then 1.21.5 may contain known security risks and are not actively patched. |
| **Newer Versions** | **Supported** | New major versions are generally supported shortly after their stable release. |

**Note:** We strongly recommend always running the latest stable version of Paper for optimal security and performance.
